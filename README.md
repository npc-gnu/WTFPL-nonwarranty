# WTFPL-nonwarranty
WTFLP license without warranty

normally i dont like licenses like MIT bcz i think they are liar. They say "hey you can close this code" but "NO DONT CHANGE THE LICENSE TEXT ðŸ˜¢" . WHICH THE FUCK ARE YOU? YOU LIKE FULLY FREE CODE OR NOT? 
So my favorites became GPL and Unlicense like licenses but... i disvovered! I FOUND A MEME LICENSE THAT NOT-LIAR FREE! **WTFPL** !
I liked it but it didn't had a warranty caution so i added that.
